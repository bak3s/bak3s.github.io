# About

## Hello, I'm Dan

I'm freelance designer, developer and teacher from Sydney Australia!

Some agencies are often focused on over-producing websites, missing out on what the fundamentals of a well designed website really are. I believe that design should be a simple, fun and approachable process.

Get in touch with me today so we can collaborate on your next project and create a clear, functional and modern web solution.
