<h2 id="preamble">Preamble…</h2>

<p>10 years ago I began working full time and had no plans, no insight, no guidance on what I should do with my money. For me just saving for a rainy day was all I could muster.</p>

<p>After fitting my first $10k in savings (a huge milestone after which I told myself “never dip below”) in a then 8% interest rate savings account I started to understand how compound interest worked.</p>

<p>I started to read books on investing - like One Up on Wall Street and From 0-130 properties, and decided property would be where I stash my money.</p>

<p>This didn’t end up going to plan, a random call from my mate changed my life. Instead of spending 30k on a house deposit for a small apartment in Marrickville was spent on a trip to Canada, where I lived and worked for over a year.</p>

<p>Now when this opportunity presented itself I said “no worry, when I return I’ll save for another deposit… property won’t go up that much in a year…” queue property boom in Sydney… where my near buy of a 350k property in Marrickville, I would now be looking at 750k.</p>

<p>So rather than saving again upon return… another call from another mate, and 12 months later I moved to London.</p>

<p>A year later I returned to Sydney, no money, no savings, no job, back to square one. Time to build it all back up… a third time. Except this time… not answering any more of those calls from my mates!</p>

<p>Now a few things have happened since then, I purchased an investment property, married my wife, had an amazing honeymoon and now have a son… the last 3 all within 12 months.</p>

<p>In the weeks after my son was born I had some time to look at our finances, work out how much we are spending, and what the next 5 years will look like… where do we want to live, what school will we send our son to? All questions and no answers…</p>

<p>Over those 6 weeks I did a few things, I took the <a href="/investing/books/learnings-from-the-barefoot-investor/">learnings from The Barefoot Investor</a>, and decide to follow that plan to knock over our debts (around 10k left over after the wedding and honeymoon), and start making our money work for us.</p>

<p>After this I decided to invest in The Barefoot Blueprint, as I was interested in shares again.</p>

<p>This is where I delve deep into dividends, compound interest and ultimately financial independence through a passive income stream.</p>

<p>Right now, I am beginning my journey into the <a href="/fire/what-is-the-fire-movement/">FI/RE movement</a>, with an aim to be able to “retire” at 40.</p>
