        <p class="intro">It all started 10 years ago...</p>

<h2 id="preamble">Preamble…</h2>

<p>Coming from a single parent family with 2 siblings I was taught early about the value of money and savings. To take care of 3 children my mother worked extremely hard, spending nearly everything on good education for us all, leaving very little.</p>

<p>Understanding the value of money (and wanting to be less of a burden on my mother), meant that as soon as I turned 14 I went looking for a job. I started out working in a seafood restaurant, my role involved washing dishes, filleting fish, and getting stabbed by prawns. For the most part during this time, I spent as much as I earned.</p>

<p>While I understood the value of money and savings, I didn’t have an understanding of what I should do with my money. My mother wasn’t into finance, just to save money for a rainy day. Good ethics to instill while I was young, but missing half the story.</p>

<h2 id="landing-my-first-full-time-job">Landing my first full time job</h2>

<p>After completing my tertiary studies, I went looking for my first full time job. After sending off over 100 cold-emails to various agencies seeking a junior level job, I was blocked by the same rason all all recent graduates do… “experience”. This is how a job advertisement looked…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Company seeking junior… must have 3 years experience…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I decided to start applying for mid to senior positions. I thought “if they are looking for seniors, they must have extra work on”. This paid off, applying for higher level positions meant less competition, though its a little strange to get to a job interview and ask for a Junior role instead. Whatever the reason, maybe the provado, but I landed my first full time job. My daily living expenses were the same, but my income jumped considerably, kicking off the start of my savings journey.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-save-10000">How to save $10,000</h2>

<p>Living at home was the main reason I could save majority of my money. I had no credit cards, no loans, I even purchased my mothers old car for $500, a 1997 Toyota Carolla that struggled to make it to 110km/h.</p>

<p>After getting my first $10k in savings (a huge milestone after which I told myself “never dip below”) in a then 8% interest rate savings account I could finally <em>see</em> what compound interest looked like.</p>

<p>Working full time in Sydney while still living at home mean’t long travel (over 1 hour each way), so I started to look into buying a property in the Inner West, nothing crazy, just a small studio/1 bedroom apartment I could call my own. At this time I didn’t have the investment mindset.</p>

<p>This is where my first major fork in my life popped up…</p>

<h2 id="how-to-spend-10000">How to spend $10,000</h2>

<p>My plan to purchase a property in the Inner West didnt go as expected, I instead packed up and left to go overseas and live in Canada for a couple of years.</p>

<p>Now when this opportunity presented itself I said “no worry, when I return I’ll save for another deposit… property won’t go up that much in a year…” queue property boom in Sydney… where my near buy of a 350k property in Marrickville, I would now be looking at 750k.</p>

<p>So rather than saving again upon return… another call from another mate, and 12 months later I moved to London.</p>

<p>A year later I returned to Sydney, no money, no savings, no job, back to square one. Time to build it all back up… a third time. Except this time… not answering any more of those calls from my mates!</p>

<p>Now a few things have happened since then, I purchased an investment property, married my wife, had an amazing honeymoon and now have a son… the last 3 all within 12 months.</p>

<p>In the weeks after my son was born I had some time to look at our finances, work out how much we are spending, and what the next 5 years will look like… where do we want to live, what school will we send our son to? All questions and no answers…</p>

<p>After this I decided to invest in <a href="#">The Barefoot Blueprint</a>, as I was interested in shares again.</p>

<p>This is where I delve deep into dividends, compound interest and ultimately financial independence through a passive income stream.</p>

<p>Right now, I am beginning my journey into the FI/RE movement, with an aim to be able to “retire” at 40.</p>
