<h3 id="this-book-did-a-few-things-for-me">This book did a few things for me…</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Acknowledge our debts, and knock off our credit cards</li>
  <li>Fix up my super</li>
  <li>Consolidate our healthcare</li>
  <li>Up my insurance coverage (including income protection)</li>
  <li>Get a better deal for our home loan</li>
  <li>Get a better deal for our personal loan</li>
  <li>Most of all it rekindled my interest in finance</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="debt-the-good-and-the-bad">Debt… the good and the bad</h3>

<p>The biggest thing about debt is understanding what debt really is, and how it effects your life.</p>

<p>Wealth is a strange thing… the biggest thing I have found is the wealthy (the real wealthy) are rarely showy when it comes to possessions… they didn’t get rich by spending money poorly.</p>

<p>It’s strange to think that when I was 20 I was earning 1/3 of what I am today, but my lifestyle was pretty similar… so it makes me wonder where all the money goes… Yes, Netflix, coffees, lunches out… but really the difference is with more income seems to incur more debt… buying slightly more expensive sunnies, a slightly better car, a slightly bigger apartment, a more expensive laptop, each leap in income comes a leap in comforts, known as <em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/08/23/slippery-slope-lifestyle-creep/">lifestyle creep</a></em>.</p>

<p>The thing about credit cards and why they are so prevalent across all banks and credit unions is because they slowly work. You start off thinking “I’m gonna use this credit card and pay it off every month, and pick up all of those free points!”. The truth is, you will slowly spend a little more than you earn and then <em>suddenly</em> 12 months later and you have maxed your credit card, and the shame kicks in.</p>

<p>That’s what happened to me and my wife… we both slowly racked up debt until it was difficult to chip away. We had 3 credit cards, 2 were maxed.</p>

<p>Back when I was 20 and earning 1/3, I didn’t have a credit card, I only spent what I needed to, and automated a small amount of my income into a high interest account (around 8% at the time).</p>

<p>These are the reasons that my increase in income didn’t result in an increase it savings, it became an increase in debt.</p>

<h4 id="debt-consolidation">Debt consolidation</h4>

<p>The Step 3 in the Barefoot steps tells you to “domino your debts”, and that’s what we did! We paid the minimum amount (probably would have been worth transferring the credit to another card with a 0% interest transfer rate), and waited for our tax return (I wasn’t claiming the 18k tax-free threshold at the time, so I knew I had some money coming in). We paid and closed all 3 credit cards once our tax return cleared.</p>

<h3 id="death-and-taxes">Death and taxes</h3>

<p>The next part was to kick off some life admin, like consolidate our super into a low management fee fund, up super contributions, and set up insurance.</p>
