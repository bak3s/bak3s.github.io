Learn the steps to become financially independent and retire early.

## Step 1 - Set your RE goal

Since the inception of FIRE from Mr Money Moustache, and his post <cite>[The shockingly simple math behind early retirement](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/)</cite>, there has been a widely accepted "4% rule" for calculating your RE goal.

### The 4% rule

The 4% rule is known as the "safe withdrawal rate", originating from <cite>Determining withdrawal rates using historial data</cite> by William P. Bengen.

> Assuming a minimum requirement of 30 years of portfolio longevity, a first-year withdrawal of 4 percent, followed by inflation-adjusted withdrawals in subsequent years, should be safe.
> <cite>William P. Bengen</cite>

This takes into consideration inflation etc, so the dollar you withdraw today is worth the same as the dollar you have withdrawn previously.

### Calculate your early retirement savings rate

Previously it was an arduous task to calculate this with spreadsheets and calculations and projections, but luckily its 2020 and there is an app for that. Head over to [Networthify](https://networthify.com/calculator/earlyretirement) and calculate your savings rate goal.

Keep in mind you current lifestyle as a basis of calculation, you can trim unecessary spend later to bring that retirement date forward.

Current projections have you retiring at retirement age? Head on to Step 2.

## Step 2 - Take control of your finances

### Make some cuts

It could be something as simple as cutting your coffee at work (and replacing with a coffee at home), or find a place with cheaper coffees (hot tip, hit up a 7eleven for a [\$1 coffee](https://www.7eleven.com.au/coffee)!).

Now cutting out coffee's doesn't seem like much, but really its about breaking bad habits, and/or replacing them with new - better - habits.

Really take a look at what you waste money on. Do you throw away lots of groceries because its easier to eat out? Do you take lunch to work or eat out? Do you pay for a gym membership you rarely use?

Typically these are the same issues we all have (including me!), and habits are hard to break - I recommend reading [Atomic Habits](https://www.booktopia.com.au/atomic-habits-james-clear/ebook/9781473537804.html) or checkout some great YouTuber's like [Thomas Frank](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG-KntY7aVnIGXYEBQvmBAQ) or [Matt D'Avella](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ24N4O0bP7LGLBDvye7oCA)

### Dominoe your debt

### Cut up your credit card

### Find savings

Renegotiating your bills may lead to some extra savings, for example moving your electricity and gas bill can often save a significant amount of money. I recommend using the Australian Government's [Energy Made Easy](https://www.energymadeeasy.gov.au/) tool, I myself saved a couple of hundred a year.

#### Phone and internet

Try call your current provider and ask for a loyalty discount, or check your current usage/plan against the current in market. Also ask if you can receive any "new customer" deals.

#### Car insurance / green slip

Shop around and compare insurance and green slip premiums. Some other ideas to enable some savings include:

- Think about making some room in your garage to park your car (if it isn't already in there!)
- Upping the minimum age of drivers
- Put your excess up higher.

#### Home and contents, and health insurances

Shop and compare insurances, and find the best deal. For health insurance, the Barefoot and I recommend [Health Partners](https://www.healthpartners.com.au/).

For health insurance, luckily the recent [private health insurance reforms](https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/private-health-insurance/private-health-insurance-reforms) make it easy to compare. Make sure to ask your provider how much of the "extras" you actually use, and if its worth it!

#### Home loan

It took some time to find a new home loan for my family, as APRA's lending changes made it a little more difficult to move. It doesnt make sense that you "can't afford" the new loan even though you may save a couple of hundred dollars a month?! Luckily it has since relaxed the lending rules making easier to move home loans. I recommend [uno Home Loans](https://unohomeloans.com.au/), who found a great deal for me.

#### Personal loan

As per the others - shop and compare, call your current lender and see what savings you could make.

If you have multiple loans, it may also be a good idea to consolidate your debt into a single credit card/personal loan with 0% transfer and 0% interest for 12 month deals, which may open some savings due to accruing interest.
