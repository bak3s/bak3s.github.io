<p class="intro">The FI/RE movement is quickly gaining momentum in Australia, and this website will be documenting my journey to financial independence.</p>

## Preamble...

10 years ago I began working full time and had no plans, no insight, no guidance on what I should do with my money. Coming from a single parent family with 2 siblings I was taught early about the value of money and savings. To take care of 3 children my mother worked extremely hard, spending nearly everything on good education for us all, leaving very little.

Understanding the value of money (and wanting to be less of a burden on my mother), meant that as soon as I turned 14 I went looking for a job. I started out working in a seafood restaurant and this is where I stayed for several years. For the most part during this time, I spent as much as I earned.

While I understood the value of money and savings, I didn't have an understanding of what I should do with my money. My mother wasn't into finance, just to save money for a rainy day. Good ethics to instill while I was young, but missing half the story.

## Landing your first full time job

After completing my tertiary studies, I went looking for my first full time job. After sending off over 100 cold-emails to various agencies seeking a junior level job, I was blocked by the same rason all all recent graduates do... "experience". This is how a job advertisement looked...

> Junior entry level position... must have 3 years experience...

So I decided to start applying for mid to senior positions. I thought "if they are looking for seniors, they must have extra work on". This paid off, applying for higher level positions meant less competition, though its a little strange to get to a job interview and ask for a Junior role instead. Whatever the reason, maybe the provado, but I landed my first full time job. My daily living expenses were the same, but my income jumped considerably, kicking off the start of my savings journey.

## How to save \$10,000

Living at home was the main reason I could save majority of my money. I had no credit cards, no loans, I even purchased my mothers old car for \$500, a 1997 Toyota Carolla that struggled to make it to 110km/h.

After getting my first \$10k in savings (a huge milestone after which I told myself “never dip below”) in a then 8% interest rate savings account I started to understand how compound interest worked.

I started to read books on investing - like One Up on Wall Street and From 0-130 properties, and decided property would be where I stash my money.

## How to spend \$10,000

This didn’t end up going to plan, a random call from my mate changed my life. Instead of spending 30k on a house deposit for a small apartment in Marrickville was spent on a trip to Canada, where I lived and worked for over a year.

Now when this opportunity presented itself I said “no worry, when I return I’ll save for another deposit... property won’t go up that much in a year...” queue property boom in Sydney... where my near buy of a 350k property in Marrickville, I would now be looking at 750k.

So rather than saving again upon return... another call from another mate, and 12 months later I moved to London.

A year later I returned to Sydney, no money, no savings, no job, back to square one. Time to build it all back up... a third time. Except this time... not answering any more of those calls from my mates!

Now a few things have happened since then, I purchased an investment property, married my wife, had an amazing honeymoon and now have a son... the last 3 all within 12 months.

In the weeks after my son was born I had some time to look at our finances, work out how much we are spending, and what the next 5 years will look like... where do we want to live, what school will we send our son to? All questions and no answers...

After this I decided to invest in [The Barefoot Blueprint](#), as I was interested in shares again.

This is where I delve deep into dividends, compound interest and ultimately financial independence through a passive income stream.

Right now, I am beginning my journey into the FI/RE movement, with an aim to be able to "retire" at 40.
