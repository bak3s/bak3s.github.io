<p class="intro">It all started 10 years ago...</p>

## Preamble...

Coming from a single parent family with 2 siblings I was taught early about the value of money and savings. To take care of 3 children my mother worked extremely hard, spending nearly everything on good education for us all, leaving very little.

Understanding the value of money (and wanting to be less of a burden on my mother), meant that as soon as I turned 14 I went looking for a job. I started out working in a seafood restaurant, my role involved washing dishes, filleting fish, and getting stabbed by prawns. For the most part during this time, I spent as much as I earned.

While I understood the value of money and savings, I didn't have an understanding of what I should do with my money. My mother wasn't into finance, just to save money for a rainy day. Good ethics to instill while I was young, but missing half the story.

## Landing my first full time job

After completing my tertiary studies, I went looking for my first full time job. After sending off over 100 cold-emails to various agencies seeking a junior level job, I was blocked by the same rason all all recent graduates do... "experience". This is how a job advertisement looked...

> Company seeking junior... must have 3 years experience...

So I decided to start applying for mid to senior positions. I thought "if they are looking for seniors, they must have extra work on". This paid off, applying for higher level positions meant less competition, though its a little strange to get to a job interview and ask for a Junior role instead. Whatever the reason, maybe the provado, but I landed my first full time job. My daily living expenses were the same, but my income jumped considerably, kicking off the start of my savings journey.

## How to save \$10,000

Living at home was the main reason I could save majority of my money. I had no credit cards, no loans, I even purchased my mothers old car for \$500, a 1997 Toyota Carolla that struggled to make it to 110km/h.

After getting my first \$10k in savings (a huge milestone after which I told myself “never dip below”) in a then 8% interest rate savings account I could finally _see_ what compound interest looked like.

Working full time in Sydney while still living at home mean't long travel (over 1 hour each way), so I started to look into buying a property in the Inner West, nothing crazy, just a small studio/1 bedroom apartment I could call my own. At this time I didn't have the investment mindset.

This is where my first major fork in my life popped up...

## How to spend \$10,000

My plan to purchase a property in the Inner West didn't go as expected, I instead packed up and left to go overseas and live for a couple of years.

> It's fairly easy to spend \$10,000 travelling.

Now when this opportunity presented itself I said “no worry, when I return I’ll save for another deposit... property won’t go up that much in a year...” queue property boom in Sydney... where my near buy of a 350k property in Marrickville, would now be closer to 750k.

## Starting over

A few years later I returned to Sydney, no money, no savings, no job... back to square one.

After working my side hustle for a few years, my partner and I saved up enough money to purchase a unit in Western Sydney.

A straight forward investment property, purchased just prior to the peak of the property boom in Australia. Luckily for us the property came with a long term tenant who stayed on for several years.

Not long after we purchased our property, I was in Dymmocks and had come across a little book called "The Barefoot Investor".

This book really spoke to my partner and I, and we [learned a lot]({% post_url 2019-10-01-learnings-from-the-barefoot-investor %}). After getting caught up in some (manageable) credit card debt, and pumping a considerable amount of money into our investment property, we started to lose control of our finances. The 9 simple steps in this book were easy to follow and extremely effective.

In a few short months we paid off all of our credit card debt, and saved huge amounts of money renegotiating contracts and insurances.

## A few years on...

Now a few things have happened since, I married my partner, had an amazing honeymoon, and now have a son... all within 12 months.

In the weeks after my son was born I had some time to look at our finances, work out how much we are spending, and what the next 5 years will look like... where do we want to live, what school will we send our son to? All questions and no answers...

After following the barefoot steps and dominoed our debts I decided to invest in The Barefoot Blueprint, as I wanted to start making our money work for us and set some long term goals.

This is where I delve deep into dividends, compound interest and ultimately financial independence through a passive income stream.

Right now, I am beginning my journey into the FI/RE movement, with an aim to be able to "retire" at 40.
