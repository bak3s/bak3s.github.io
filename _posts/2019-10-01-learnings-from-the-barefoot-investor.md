## Book: [The Barefoot Investor](https://barefootinvestor.com/)

### This book did a few things for me...

- Rekindle my interest in finance
- Acknowledge our debts
- Fix up my super
- Consolidate our healthcare
- Up my insurance coverage (including income protection)
- Knock off our credit cards (from 3 down to 1)
- Get a better deal for our home loan
- Get a better deal for our personal loan
- Fee erosion

### Debt... the good and the bad

The biggest thing about debt is understanding what debt is, and how it effects your life.

Good debt are typically things like HECS or a Mortgage. This is because there is some type of return on the investment, and has little erosion or depreciation.

Bad debt includes credit cards and cars. They say the second you buy a car it halves in value. So why buy a brand new car when you can save 50% buy getting a used car.

Wealth is a strange thing... the biggest thing I have found is the wealthy (the real wealthy) are rarely showy when it comes to possessions... they don’t get rich by spending money poorly.

It’s strange to think that when I was 20 I was earning 1/3 of what I am today, but my lifestyle was pretty similar... so it makes me wonder where all the money goes... Yes Netflix, coffees, lunches out... but really the difference is with more income seems to incur more debt... buying slightly more expensive sunnies, a slightly better car, a slightly bigger apartment, a more expensive laptop, each leap in income comes a leap in comforts, known as _[lifestyle creep](https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/08/23/slippery-slope-lifestyle-creep/)_.

The Barefoot shows us how this debt builds... marketing, indoctrination, comparison.

The thing about credit cards and why they are so prevalent across all banks and credit unions is because they slowly work. You start off thinking- I’m gonna use this credit card and pay it off every month, and pick up all of those free points?!” But the truth is, you will slowly spend a little more than you earn... and you will always so... oh I’ll pay it next month... 12 months later and you have maxed your CC, and the shame and denial kicks in.

That’s what happened to me and my wife... we both slowly racked up debt until it was difficult to chip away. We had 3 credit cards, 2 were maxed.

Back when I was 20 and earning 1/3, I didn’t have a credit card, I only spent what I needed to, and automated a small amount of my income into a high interest account (around 8% at the time).

These are the reasons that my increase in income didn’t result in an increase it savings, it became an increase in debt.

The first thing Barefoot suggests is to “domino your debts”. And that’s what we did! We paid the minimum amount (probably would have been worth transferring the credit to another card with a 0% interest transfer rate) and waited for our tax return (I wasn’t claiming the 18k tax-free threshold at the time, so I knew I had some money coming in). We paid and closed all 3 credit cards in on fell swoop.

### Death and taxes

The next part was to kick off some life admin, like consolidate your super in a low management fee fund, up your super contributions, and set up your insurances.
