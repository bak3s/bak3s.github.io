## What is micro-investing?

Micro-investing is handy when you don't have enough capital to invest in stocks, but want to own shares in a company or group of companies.

Typically when you are investing with micro transactions, you are buying an unlisted fund. Unlisted funds are not traded on the ASX, instead you purchase a "unit", and the unit is tracked against the listed companies, ETF or fund.

Micro-investing with apps in Australia is easy, and the minimum amount to invest to start is low. Apps like Raiz allow you to round-up your credit or debit card purchases and automatically invest. However, it is worth noting that after a certain threshold there may be a management fee.

## Fractional shares

If you don't want to be locked into these micro investing apps, it may be worth considering buying Fractional Trading, where you can enter a dollar amount and the broker will purchase fractions to total out the transaction.
