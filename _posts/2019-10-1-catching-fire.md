The [FI/RE movement]({% post_url 2019-10-1-what-is-the-fire-movement %}) is quickly gaining moment in Australia, and its what I have been looking for for quite some time.

This website will be documenting my journey to financial independence.

## Preamble...

10 years ago I began working full time and had no plans, no insight, no guidance on what I should do with my money. For me just saving for a rainy day was all I could muster.

After fitting my first \$10k in savings (a huge milestone after which I told myself “never dip below”) in a then 8% interest rate savings account I started to understand how compound interest worked.

I started to read books on investing - like One Up on Wall Street and From 0-130 properties, and decided property would be where I stash my money.

This didn’t end up going to plan, a random call from my mate changed my life. Instead of spending 30k on a house deposit for a small apartment in Marrickville was spent on a trip to Canada, where I lived and worked for over a year.

Now when this opportunity presented itself I said “no worry, when I return I’ll save for another deposit... property won’t go up that much in a year...” queue property boom in Sydney... where my near buy of a 350k property in Marrickville, I would now be looking at 750k.

So rather than saving again upon return... another call from another mate, and 12 months later I moved to London.

A year later I returned to Sydney, no money, no savings, no job, back to square one. Time to build it all back up... a third time. Except this time... not answering any more of those calls from my mates!

Now a few things have happened since then, I purchased an investment property, married my wife, had an amazing honeymoon and now have a son... the last 3 all within 12 months.

In the weeks after my son was born I had some time to look at our finances, work out how much we are spending, and what the next 5 years will look like... where do we want to live, what school will we send our son to? All questions and no answers...

Over those 6 weeks I did a few things, I took the learnings from [The Barefoot Investor](https://barefootinvestor.com/), and decide to follow that plan to knock over our debts (around 10k left over after the wedding and honeymoon), and start making our money work for us.

## The Barefoot Investor

This book did a few things for me...

1. Rekindle my interest in finance
2. Acknowledge our debts
3. Fix up my super
4. Consolidate our healthcare
5. Up my insurance coverage (including income protection)
6. Knock off our credit cards (from 3 down to 1)
7. Get a better deal for our home loan
8. Get a better deal for our personal loan

After this I decided to invest in The Barefoot Blueprint, as I was interested in shares again.

This is where I delve deep into dividends, compound interest and ultimately financial independence through a passive income stream.

Right now, I am beginning my journey into the fire movement, with an aim to be able to "retire" at 40.
